Learning Unit 1-4

1.Introduction to HTML

HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.
Hypertext defines the link between web pages.  
A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
HTML can be combined with CSS and JavaScript.

CSS
Cascading Style sheet is used to format the style of the webpage.
You can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out.
There are three ways to add CSS to HTML files:
Inline linking- an inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element
Internal linking- an internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
Exarernal linking- an external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

JavaScript
JavaScript is a language used in Web development.
JavaScript is used to make interactive sites.
When working with files for the web, JavaScript needs to be loaded and run alongside HTML markup. 
You can add JavaScript code in an HTML document by employing the dedicated HTML tag <script> that wraps around JavaScript code.

2.HTML Text Formating
Text formatting in HTML refers to the way text is displayed on a web page.
 HTML offers a range of tags that can be used to format text including:
 Bold text: `<b>` or `<strong>`. We can make the text bold using the <b> tag. The tag uses both opening and closing tags. The text that needs to be made bold must be within <b> and </b> tag
 Italicised text: <i> or <em>. The <i> tag is used to italicise the text. It opens with <i> and ends with </i> tag and <em> tag is used to emphasize the text, with added semantic importance. It opens with <em> and ends with </em> tag. 
 Superscript and subscript text: <sup> or <sub>. The <sup> element is used to superscript a text and the <sub> element is used to subscript a text. They both have an opening and a closing tag.\

 HTML Elements
 An element is a section of an HTML document. Some HTML elements represent visible components on a web page, such as text, images, or buttons.
 HTML elements tell the browser how to display the text, images, and other content on the page, as well as tell the browser other useful bits of information.
 HTML elements are created with tags. An HTML tag consists of text between angle brackets (<>). for an example an HTML paragraph elememnt looks like this <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
 
 HTML Headlines/Headings
 HTML headings are used to define the headings of a page.
 There are six levels of headings defined by HTML. These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.

 HTML Lists
 Lists are used to specify lists of information. 
 All lists must contain one or more lists elements.
 There are three types of lists namely:
 Unordered list- present items that do not have a particular sequence or order, they are displayed with bullet points and this is how an unordered list is created:
 <ul>
  <li>Koketso</li>
  <li>Motsikwe</li>
  <li>Moyakhe</li>
</ul>
 Orderedlist- Are used when you want to present items in a specific sequence or order. They are typically displayed by numbers or letters.
 Definition list. This is an example
