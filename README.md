1.Introduction to HTML

HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.
Hypertext defines the link between web pages.  
A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
HTML can be combined with CSS and JavaScript.

CSS
Cascading Style sheet is used to format the style of the webpage.
You can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out.
There are three ways to add CSS to HTML files:
Inline linking- an inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element
Internal linking- an internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
Exarernal linking- an external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

JavaScript
JavaScript is a language used in Web development.
JavaScript is used to make interactive sites.
When working with files for the web, JavaScript needs to be loaded and run alongside HTML markup. 
You can add JavaScript code in an HTML document by employing the dedicated HTML tag <script> that wraps around JavaScript code.
